""" Order type filling
Volume filling policy is specified in the ORDER_TYPE_FILLING order property and
may contain only the values from the ENUM_ORDER_TYPE_FILLING enumeration.

`ORDER_FILLING_FOK`:
An order can be executed in the specified volume only.
If the necessary amount of a financial instrument is currently unavailable in the market, the order will not be executed.
The desired volume can be made up of several available offers.
The possibility of using FOK orders is determined at the trade server.

`ORDER_FILLING_IOC`:
A trader agrees to execute a deal with the volume maximally available in the market within that indicated in the order.
If the request cannot be filled completely, an order with the available volume will be executed, and the remaining volume will be canceled.
The possibility of using IOC orders is determined at the trade server.

`ORDER_FILLING_BOC`:
The BoC order assumes that the order can only be placed in the Depth of Market and cannot be immediately executed.
If the order can be executed immediately when placed, then it is canceled.

In fact, the BOC policy guarantees that the price of the placed order will be worse than the current market.
BoC orders are used to implement passive trading, so that the order is not executed immediately when placed and does not affect current liquidity.

Only limit and stop limit orders are supported (ORDER_TYPE_BUY_LIMIT, ORDER_TYPE_SELL_LIMIT, ORDER_TYPE_BUY_STOP_LIMIT, ORDER_TYPE_SELL_STOP_LIMIT).

`ORDER_FILLING_RETURN`:
In case of partial filling, an order with remaining volume is not canceled but processed further.
Return orders are not allowed in the Market Execution mode (market execution â€” SYMBOL_TRADE_EXECUTION_MARKET).
